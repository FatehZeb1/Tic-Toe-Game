# Tic-Toe-Game
The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with two players: X (user) and O (computer). The game starts with an empty grid, and players take turns marking a square. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
